## Getting Started

This is a Next.js template for creating e-commerce application using the Commerce.js CMS. All you need to get started is already avialable.

To start building your application install all packages in the package.json:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Once everything is installed run the developement server using:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Next Steps

Currently the Commerce.js SDk is set up using thier example API, so you'd need to create a .env file with your public Commerce.js API so that you could see your available products.

This template uses Stipe as a payment gateway, in order to use it you must first sign up for Stripe and use your API in order to use the service.
